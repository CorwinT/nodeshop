# NodeShop

This is my take on a Node.js powered E-Commerce system. The main framework used is Express, with Jade handling the view engine and Passport handling user authentication.

The project is still very much work in progress, and any help would be much appreciated.

Here are some known areas with issues that need addressing:

  * Checkout incomplete
  * Product image storage and retrieval system needed
  * Product page is incomplete
  * Search does not work
  * No method of payment yet


#Update 28 June '13

Tidied up some more code, updated the file structure. Added a guest checkout with form validation. Coming soon will be the order form with some kind of payment system, probably paypal.

Started working on an admin area which is coming along, will probably be in the next release.

#Update 23 May '13

Quite a few areas of the system have been tidied up and improved, most notably the shopping cart, the basics of a checkout, the category system and the login system. 

The checkout is moving towards something that may be usable quite soon so watch this space! 

Also planned is an admin area, which I am considering running as a seperate server. This would make it secure and easy to access from a development envrironment.
